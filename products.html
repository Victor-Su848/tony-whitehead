        <p>Since the early 1980s, as the multiple methodological and conceptual systems of the Cultural Ecology of Health and Change (the CEHC) began to occupy his thinking, Dr. Whitehead began to give less time to writing for the scholarly review process, as he did to the development to these systems.  At that time, and for the remainder of his career, he became involved in so many research and professional practice projects and consultations, both in the US and abroad, he increasingly found himself needing to develop somewhat standardized systems that would help to guide his own work, and in his training of students and professionals involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of community health and development programs.   However, attached are some of his contributions to the peer review publishing process that reflected experiences that also contributed to the CEHC’s evolution. </p>
